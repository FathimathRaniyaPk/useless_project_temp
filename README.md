### Project Description
Minda Poocha ‚Äî The Alarm That Thinks It‚Äôs Funny!

Minda Poocha ‚Äî The Alarm That Thinks It‚Äôs Funny!
Set your alarm for 7 AM? Nah, Minda Poocha will wake you at 7 PM instead ‚Äî just to keep things spicy. Snooze button? More like confuse button. Want 5 minutes? Get ready for a surprise 30-minute nap instead!

It‚Äôs the alarm that‚Äôs always late, never listens, and basically throws a wild party when you‚Äôre supposed to be waking up. Perfect if you love chaos, surprises, and waking up wondering, ‚ÄúDid I even set an alarm?‚Äù

Minda Poocha: Because normal alarms are just too boring. üòÇ‚è∞üéâ



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world obsessed with punctuality, Minda Poocha tackles the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of overly predictable alarms that kill your morning vibe. It injects chaos and surprise into your wake-up routine, helping you embrace unpredictability instead of boring routine. Because sometimes, the real problem is being too on time.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Minda Poocha solves the non-problem of boring, obedient alarms by randomly messing with your wake-up time‚Äîbecause who wants predictability anyway? It turns snooze into a guessing game and makes every morning an unexpected adventure. Finally, an alarm that refuses to listen, just like your inner procrastinator.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-  We used HTML for the framework and structure of the app.

- CSS (with Tailwind) was used for styling and creating a modern, responsive UI.

- JavaScript powers the alarm logic, interactivity, timing functions, and user input handling.
  

### Implementation
For Software:Build a simple webpage with a funny alarm title and quotes. Let users set an alarm time, but the app purposely rings at the wrong time (AM alarms ring in PM). The snooze button works unpredictably, and the alarm sound plays until stopped. Use HTML for layout, CSS for style, and JavaScript to handle time checking, sound playing, and page navigation.

  first.html

This is the first page of our app, inspired by the Malayalam proverb ‚Äò‡¥Æ‡¥ø‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡¥æ‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µÇ‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö ‡¥ï‡¥≤‡¥Æ‡µÅ‡¥ü‡¥Ø‡µç‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥Ç‚Äô (Even the quiet cat will act when the time comes). Just like the proverb, our alarm breaks all boring wake-up rules quiet until it‚Äôs time to surprise you, because normal alarms are too predictable.

  home.html
This is the second page of our app  the control hub for your unconventional wake-ups. Here you set, manage and tweak all your alarms. Whether it‚Äôs for a morning run, study jam, or a spontaneous outing, this page keeps your ‚ÄòMinda Poocha‚Äô spirit alive by making sure no alarm is just‚Ä¶ ordinary and if you like, you can upgrade to the Pro version  if you want even more chaos with this.

 timer.html
This is the third page of our project the only useful yet practically useless feature in our project. Set a timer then pick a sound and wait‚Ä¶ but here‚Äôs the twist: the Stop button won‚Äôt stay still. It floats across the screen, dodging your clicks. Perfect for adding chaos to your most important tasks  because why not make life harder in the most entertaining way possible?"
