### Project Description
Minda Poocha ‚Äî The Alarm That Thinks It‚Äôs Funny!

Minda Poocha ‚Äî The Alarm That Thinks It‚Äôs Funny!
Set your alarm for 7 AM? Nah, Minda Poocha will wake you at 7 PM instead ‚Äî just to keep things spicy. Snooze button? More like confuse button. Want 5 minutes? Get ready for a surprise 30-minute nap instead!

It‚Äôs the alarm that‚Äôs always late, never listens, and basically throws a wild party when you‚Äôre supposed to be waking up. Perfect if you love chaos, surprises, and waking up wondering, ‚ÄúDid I even set an alarm?‚Äù

Minda Poocha: Because normal alarms are just too boring. üòÇ‚è∞üéâ



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world obsessed with punctuality, Minda Poocha tackles the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of overly predictable alarms that kill your morning vibe. It injects chaos and surprise into your wake-up routine, helping you embrace unpredictability instead of boring routine. Because sometimes, the real problem is being too on time.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Minda Poocha solves the non-problem of boring, obedient alarms by randomly messing with your wake-up time‚Äîbecause who wants predictability anyway? It turns snooze into a guessing game and makes every morning an unexpected adventure. Finally, an alarm that refuses to listen, just like your inner procrastinator.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-  We used HTML for the framework and structure of the app.

- CSS (with Tailwind) was used for styling and creating a modern, responsive UI.

- JavaScript powers the alarm logic, interactivity, timing functions, and user input handling.
  

### Implementation
For Software:Build a simple webpage with a funny alarm title and quotes. Let users set an alarm time, but the app purposely rings at the wrong time (AM alarms ring in PM). The snooze button works unpredictably, and the alarm sound plays until stopped. Use HTML for layout, CSS for style, and JavaScript to handle time checking, sound playing, and page navigation.
